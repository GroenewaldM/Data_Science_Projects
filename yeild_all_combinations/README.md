# Yeild All Combos


## Summary

This program yeilds all possible combinations of items (in this case it is cows) that can be transported together without exceeding the weight limit during any trip. It then returns the combination of items that results in the least amount of trips required to transport all items without exceeding the trip weight limit.


## Getting Started

* Download the distribution code from https://github.com/GroenewaldM/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/yeild_all_combinations.
* Run yeild_all_combos.py


## Understanding

The main function takes 2 arguments: a dictionary of items names and their weights and the maximum weight that can be take during each trip.


## Example Output

py -m yeild_all_combos

[['MooMoo', 'Miss Bella'], ['Clover', 'Polaris', 'Milkshake'], ['Louis', 'Horns'], ['Lotus', 'Muscles'], ['Patches']]
[['Abby', 'Buttercup', 'Rose', 'Betsy'], ['Coco', 'Willow'], ['Starlight', 'Luna']]
