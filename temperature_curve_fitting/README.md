# Curve Fitting

## Summary

This program:
* Finds the curve that best fits the given data.
* Plots all models on a graph with the given data.


## Getting Started

* Download the distribution code from https://github.com/GroenewaldM/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/temperature_curve_fitting.
* Run curve_fitting.py

## Understanding

In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted R², is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. In general, the higher the R-squared value, the better the model fits your data.

This program calculates the R² value for each model to determine the best fit.
