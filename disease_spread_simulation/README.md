# Disease Spread Simulation

## Summary

This program:
* Simulates the growth of a virus population (of both drug resistant and non-drug resistant virises) within a patient.
* Simulates the virus population and compares the population size of of both drug resistant and non-drug resistant virises after the addition of particular drugs.
* Plots the resistant and non-resistant virus population over time with the addition of different types of drugs.
