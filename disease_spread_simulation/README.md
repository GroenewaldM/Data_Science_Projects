# Disease Spread Simulation

## Summary

This program:
* Simulates the growth of a virus population (total virus population as well as drug resistant virus population) within a patient.
* Simulates the virus population and compares the total population size to the population size of drug resistant viruses after the addition of particular drugs.
* Plots the total virus population as well as the drug resistant virus population over time with the addition of different types of drugs.  


## Getting Started

* Download the distribution code from https://github.com/GroenewaldM/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/disease_spread_simulation.
